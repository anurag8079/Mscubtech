        <p>remote hosts on the internet. The main difference from static IP addresses is that the dynamic IPs 
            provided by the ISP are not permanent. They will change when the router disconnects and reconnects, 
            re-registers to a network operator or, in some cases, the ISP might update the IP addresses periodically.
            Speaking in terms of remote access, dynamic IPs complicate the situation because there is no way to 
            tell what IP address a remote has at any given time. While remote access is more complicated with 
            dynamic IP addresses, it is not impossible and can be achieved using the Dynamic DNS service (Services 
            â†’ Dynamic DNS). DNS or Domain Name Service provides names (such as www.google.com, 
            www.facebook.com) for IP addresses. Dynamic DNS periodically rebinds IP addresses to a hostname. 
            Therefore, when using Dynamic DNS you would only have to remember the hostname to reach a specific 
            device at any given time even though its IP address might change from time to time
